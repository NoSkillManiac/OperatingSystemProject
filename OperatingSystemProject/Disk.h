//unlike memory, the disk is expected to have it's own drivers which is why I am implementing
//the disk in this manner. Unlike memory where the operating system must specify the value of
//every word of ram individually while also reading every word of ram individually,
//with the disk, the os must simply perform file operations while the disk does the rest.

//I am not implementing this as a set of linked lists with a counter (the easier way) because
//I wanted to more closely simulate an actual hdd by having fake sectors like a hdd stored
//as an array. Since the hdd is so small, each sector is only one word long rather than
//64K or more like a real hdd.
